# password_generator
It's like the Siri suggested passwords but you can pick how strong you want the password to be.
This is the toughest Python exercise I've done to date (9/30/2021).
I am so proud of this exercise. I had to Google a lot of issues, read StackOverflow, make separate pages to test out parts of the code.
This was the exercise that made me feel like a real developer. I hate the Siri passwords, but recognize their value.
I actually looked up examples of the best kinds of passwords and what weren't good passwords
ie. real life research informed how I designed the password generator.
